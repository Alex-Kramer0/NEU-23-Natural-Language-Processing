# NLP
Natural Language Processing

## Course Overview
NLP is about getting computers to perform useful and interesting tasks involving spoken and written human
language. NLP is sometimes referred to as Computational Linguistics to emphasize the fact that it involves the
combination of CS methods with research insights from Linguistics (the study of human language). Practical
applications of NLP include question answering, machine translation, information extraction, and interactive
dialog systems (both written and spoken). Modern NLP systems rely heavily on methods involving probability,
linear algebra, and calculus --- often in combination with machine learning methods.
We'll be exploring both applications and the computational methods behind them. You should be prepared to
get your hands dirty in terms of the math, programming, and data that comprise the behind the scenes
components of NLP systems.

Expect a heavy emphasis on data, how systems are deployed in the real world, and engaging in critical
thought about provided reading materials.

NLP is not just generative AI, and you can expect a significant fraction of this course to inspect other aspects
of NLP (even though we'll cover generative AI models like ChatGPT, GPT-3, GPT-4, etc).

## Course Goals
1. Develop an understanding of the general problems that people who work on NLP study and the
strategies they use to solve them.
2. Understand the role of data, machine learning, and neural networks in NLP systems.
3. Understand the ethical considerations and potentials for bias in NLP systems.
4. Be able to implement models to solve some "standard" NLP problems.
5. Be able to formulate potential starting points given a new problem with NLP elements.
6. Understand some of the motivating linguistic phenomena that make NLP problems hard and why these
can be hard phenomena for computers to approach.
